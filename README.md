# Doctor-Prolog

This was a collaborative project I worked on at SUNY Oswego with Keith Allen (github.com/KeithTAllen) and Timothy Germakovski for fulfillment of course CSC 366 - Computational Models of Cognitive Processes

Our goal was to computationally model a cognitive process in Prolog that, at minimum, involves both foundational knowledge about the way the world is understood to work and situational knowledge, and some sort of belief revision.
